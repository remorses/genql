Inspirations of this library are existing projects like

-   [Graphql Zeus](https://github.com/graphql-editor/graphql-zeus)
-   [Graphql typed client](https://github.com/helios1138/graphql-typed-client)

I wanted to build a library that had all the existing features and more:

-   Result type fields inferred
-   Fields auto completion and required fields validation
-   Fragments creation
-   Use variables instead of string interpolation
-   Subscription support
-   Chain syntax using proxy objects
-   Generate queries without using the client
-   use the everything object to query all scalar fields
