-   Easier variables passing

graphql zeus

```ts
const test = await Gql.mutation(
    {
        addCard: [
            {
                card: $`card`,
            },
            {
                id: true,
            },
        ],
    },
    {
        card: {
            Attack: 2,
            Defense: 3,
            description: 'Lord of the mountains',
            name: 'Golrog',
        },
    },
)
```

Genql

```ts
await client.mutation({
    addCard: [
        {
            card: {
                Attack: 2,
                Defense: 3,
                description: 'Lord of the mountains',
                name: 'Golrog',
            },
        },
        {
            id: true,
        },
    ],
})
```

-   Chain syntax: https://genql.now.sh/docs/usage/using-chain-syntax
-   Genql has subscriptions: https://genql.now.sh/docs/usage/subscriptions
-   Genql has batching built in: https://genql.now.sh/docs/usage/batching-queries
-   Genql has a dependency on `@genql/runtime`, graphql zeus does not
-   Genql does not support aliases
-   Genql will have a big bundle size for large graphql schemas because it needs to store some schema information, this information is really compressed but it can be a problem for large schemas (see an example of this data [here](https://github.com/remorses/genql/blob/v2.4.0/example-usage/generated/types.esm.js))
- With genql you can easily fetch all scalar fields of a type: https://genql.now.sh/docs/usage/selecting-fields#querying-all-fields
